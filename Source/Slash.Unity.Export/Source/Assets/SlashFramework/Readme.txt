// Slash Framework
// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Setup
-----

- Import Slash.Framework.[Version].unitypackage into your project (you probably already did if you read this file).

- There are several addon packages to make the framework work with other Unity assets. If you are using an addon, double click on the AddonName.unitypackage in Slash.Framework/Addons to extract the addon-specific scripts.

- If it's the first time you are using the Slash framework:
-- Check the examples in Slash.Framework/Examples
-- Read through the documentation at https://github.com/SlashGames/slash-framework/wiki
-- The API of the classes is documented at http://slashgames.org/framework/api

- If you encounter any issues (bugs, missing features,...) please create a new issue at the official issue tracker at https://github.com/SlashGames/slash-framework/issues

- Any feedback, positive as well as negative, is always appreciated at contact@slashgames.org Thanks for your help!
